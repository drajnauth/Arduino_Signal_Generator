# Arduino_Signal_Generator
Arduino programs that allows manipulation of the Si5351 to produce a poor man's Sig Gen. 

Its a work in progress and there are a few improvements and a few bugs to be fixed. Caveat emptor.

There are three version of the Sig Gen software here:

1) Original 20x2 LCD version: "VE3OOI_Si5351_Signal_Generator_v0.3". Lots of bugs in this version.  Needs the "LiquidCrystal_I2C (NewliquidCrystal)" library.  

2) Interim release of the 40x4 LCD PARC SNA: "PARC_Si5351_Signal_Generator_E_v0.1a. Needs the "hd44780" LCD Library and the "Etherkit_Si5351-2.1.2" Si5351 library.  Limited functionality.

3) The 40x4 LCD PARC pre-release of the Sig Gen: "PARC_Si5351_Signal_Generator_A_v0.1b". Needs the "hd44780" LCD Library

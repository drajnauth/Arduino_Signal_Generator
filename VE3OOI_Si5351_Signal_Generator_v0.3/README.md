# Arduino_Signal_Generator
This is the original Arduino programs that allows manipulation of the Si5351 to produce a poor man's Sig Gen.  It support a nano connected to a 4x20 LCD with a single push button and rotary encoder. 

Its a work in progress and there are a few improvements and a few bugs to be fixed. There are known issues with the debouncing of the rotaty encoder and push buttons. As well the Si5351 software does not support frequenies above 114 Mhz.  Special things needs to be done to support higher frequencies.  Subequent work has been compeleted and the software not support 2 Khz to 200 Mhz.  Caveat emptor.

# Arduino_Signal_Generator
Peel Amateur Radio Club Arduino program for the Signal Generator that will be built at the 2019 Spring Builathon.  Its the first release that uses the following libraries:

1) NT7S EtherKit Arduino Library: https://github.com/etherkit/Si5351Arduino

2) duinoWitchery hd44780 LCD Library: https://github.com/duinoWitchery/hd44780

The NT7S library has limitation and faciliates the setting 3 independant frequencies on each Si5351 CLK output as well as provides quadature output between frequencies of 5 MHz to 60 Mhz.  These are hardcoded limits.  The library supports close to 100 Mhz.  The library appears to be stable between 4 Mhz to 114 Mhz.
